# Changelog

## v4.6.1 — May 25, 2026

### What's New

### Improvements
- Further stability improvements when loading into chats.
- Improved password manager and iCloud Keychain AutoFill support on the sign-in screen.

### Bug Fixes

## v4.5.1 — May 16, 2026

### Improvements
- Images embedded directly in responses now display inline with no raw data visible during generation

### Bug Fixes

### Improvements
- Added a share button to inline Rich UI embeds.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed double requests (false emoji generation) being sent on every request.


## v4.3 — May 13, 2026

### Improvements
- Input bar buttons and icons now scale with your Accessibility UI Scale setting in both chat and channel views.
- Code block/native visualization performance has been drastically improved - While streaming code blocks that could contain 600+ lines, UI remains responsive and lag free!
- Markdown underlying improvements.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed streaming haptics not firing during streaming.

- Fixed a jitter when dismissing the keyboard by scrolling — the input bar now glides down in perfect sync with the keyboard instead of snapping after it closes.
- Fixed continuous main-thread animation frames competing with the WebContent render during HTML streaming, causing visible lag when JS-heavy content streams in.


## v4.2.2 — May 12, 2026

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed app not showing the update notification for new versions
- Fixed pending accounts incorrectly entering the app on relaunch
- Fixed pipe/function models throwing error due to latest owui changes

## v4.2.1 — May 12, 2026

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed update notification popup appearing every time the app launches — once dismissed, it won't reappear for that version; the update icon in the sidebar stays visible so you can tap it anytime.
- Fixed widgets not rendering properly.


## v4.2 — May 10, 2026

### What's New
- Terminal now has a fullscreen mode — tap the expand button in the terminal toolbar to open a full-screen terminal view with more room to work.
- Terminal now shows a quick-action shortcut bar with Tab, history up/down (↑ ↓), and Clear buttons for faster keyboard-free input.

### Improvements
- Terminal shell now starts warming up as soon as you enable terminal access, so input is ready instantly when you open the panel.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed terminal output displaying raw ANSI escape codes (e.g. `[1m[96m…[0m`) instead of clean text.
- Fixed terminal access (terminal_id) still being included in chat requests even after disabling the terminal toggle.
- Fixed server update changelog showing raw HTML code blocks or being invisible — now renders as native SwiftUI views with bold titles and color-coded category labels.
- Server update sheet now shows the server's favicon as the icon (with a server.rack fallback if unavailable).
- Fixed conversation tags not appearing — tags were being read from the wrong field in the server response; now correctly reads from the updated server format.
- Fixed conversation timestamps (created/updated dates) showing the wrong time after loading a chat — the server sends them as integers which weren't being handled correctly.


## v4.1 — May 8, 2026

### What's New
- Long-press any chat inside a folder to enter selection mode — multi-select, then remove from folder, move to another folder, or delete in bulk.
- Added "Move to Folder" button in the main chat list's selection toolbar — select multiple chats and move them all into a folder at once.
- Added server update notifications — the app now checks your Open WebUI server for available updates on launch. A "Check for Server Updates" button is also available in About → Server.
- Image size reduction - 5mb cap on vision models cause error if the image is too big.
- Native visualizations now support audio output.

### Improvements
- Minor code block performance improvements.
- Removed "Clear Local Cache" option from Privacy & Security settings as Storage Menu covers it all.

### Bug Fixes
- Terminal now runs as a persistent bash session with proper stdin support; suppressed harmless startup warnings
- Fixed terminal remaining active for the model after disabling it — the model no longer receives terminal access when the toggle is off
- Fixed admin-disabled terminal servers appearing as available and being silently used in requests
- Fixed multi-server terminal: switching servers with the toggle off no longer leaves a stale server selected that could re-activate on the next enable
- Fixed folders only showing up to 10 chats — now loads all chats across all pages smoothly
- Fixed typing indicator animation
- Fixed update notice incorrectly triggering based on GitHub tags instead of the actual App Store version.


## v4.0 — May 5, 2026

### What's New
- Added dedicated Input Box Text size slider in Accessibility settings — independently scale the font in the chat and channel message composer.
- A complete re-write of the streaming pipeline — Massively improved streaming performance. App should feel fully responsive while streaming. 

### Improvements
- Switching between chats should feel smoother. 
- Screen now stays on while TTS is reading a response aloud, just like during voice calls.
- Voice calls now respect the admin-configured Voice Mode prompt from OpenWebUI's interface settings — the model automatically receives the right system prompt to keep responses concise and speech-friendly.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed nested code blocks rendering as plain text.
- Fixed citation source icons showing as letter avatars instead of favicons.
- Known Issue: Inline visualizer plugin is not correctly working with the new re-write and needs a bit more work. Continue using the native visualizer which works perfectly and much better than pluggin. In future, the pluggin support may be dropped as it requires lot of processing since its written for the webui (includes iframe code in the tool block) and causes lag and has no real benifit over the native visualization. 


## v3.5 — May 3, 2026

### What's New
- Added user valve editor for tools — tap the gear icon next to any tool in the tools picker to configure its settings.
- Added in-app update notice — the app checks for new versions on every launch and shows a sheet with release notes; tapping "Later" dismisses it and leaves an update icon next to the New Chat button in sidebar so you can reopen it anytime.
- Added star button to every tool in the tools picker — tap ⭐ to instantly pin it as a quick-action pill in the chat input, no settings detour required.

### Improvements
- Tool call results now display with full syntax highlighting and virtual windowing — only the visible portion is rendered, matching how regular code blocks work.
- Streaming responses now scroll more smoothly with less jank, reduced CPU usage, and no animation stutter.
- Dramatically improved performance for reasoning/thinking models — the app no longer gets slower as the model thinks longer.
- Channel deletes, edits, reactions, and pins from other devices now appear live without needing to refresh.
- Deleting a channel message now animates out instantly instead of waiting for the server.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed TTS audio not playing through earbuds or wired headphones in both chat read-aloud and voice calls.
- Fixed regenerated responses not showing server errors in the chat bubble
- Fixed the chat not scrolling to the regenerating message — regenerating a response now animates the view to the new message the same way sending does.
- Fixed non-toggleable filters incorrectly appearing under Default Filters in the model editor.
- Fixed toggle-filter functions in the tools picker always turning on when globally enabled, ignoring the model's configured default state.
- Fixed crash in channels when deleting a message.
- Fixed channel context menu appearing off-screen when the keyboard was open.
- Fixed new chats always starting with the last-used model instead of the server-configured default model.
- Fixed Settings → Default Model changes not applying to new chats opened in the same session.
- Hidden models (disabled by an admin in OpenWebUI) no longer appear in the model picker or the Default Model setting.
- Fixed thinking blocks breaking the "Explored N" tool-call grouping on reasoning models — all tool calls now collapse into a single pill as expected.

### What's New
- Added Native Inline Live Visualization  — charts, graphs, svgs and interactive visualizations now render LIVE directly inside chat messages. No need for Inline visualizer pluggin (Works with it as well!). Add "output the code in one file" (or create a prompt in your worspace instead of typing it each time) at the end of your prompt and watch it get built live!

### Improvements
- Consecutive tool calls from different tools now group into a single collapsible row, matching the web UI.
- Citation badges in AI responses now show domain names by default instead of full page titles, and correctly render grouped citations like [1, 2, 3]. Toggle between domain and title in Settings → Chat Behavior.
- Improved math rendering accuracy — formulas inside code blocks now correctly restore their original delimiters instead of showing placeholder text.
- Tables with clickable links now handle taps more reliably, and table cells are reused more efficiently for smoother scrolling.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed JavaScript not executing in HTML code block previews — interactive apps like Kanban boards, games, and dashboards now work correctly, including drag-and-drop, button clicks, and localStorage persistence.
- Switching accounts now instantly clears the chat list and reloads conversations, folders, and channels for the new account.
- Fixed some action buttons not working that required js to complete its task.

### What's New
- Experimental significant memory reduction approach + a more responsive UI and faster streaming.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed Shift+Enter not inserting a new line on the first use after app restart on iPad with a hardware keyboard.


## v2.4 — March 31, 2026

### What's New
- Added Storage browser in Settings — view all app storage usage and use quick-action buttons to clear caches or remove ML model files in one tap.
- Added multi-language support for 56 languages (Hindi, Chinese, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, Polish, and many more).
- Added in-app Language picker in Settings → Display — browse all supported languages.

### Improvements

- Long-press any pinned model in the sidebar to unpin it directly, without having to open the model picker.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed Marvis Neural TTS producing garbled/garbage audio on responses that contain bullet lists, or paragraphs ending with a colon — the text preprocessor no longer generates invalid "colon-period" sequences that the model can't handle.
- Fixed server-side TTS accumulating gigabytes of temporary audio files over time — each spoken sentence now deletes its temp file immediately after playback, and any unplayed files are cleaned up when TTS is stopped.
- Fixed app crash when backgrounding during on-device speech-to-text transcription.
- Fixed thinking/reasoning blocks not responding to taps while a response is streaming — you can now expand or collapse the thinking block at any time during streaming.
- Fixed memories getting disabled by itself — pinning a model, changing the default model, or toggling memory from any screen no longer wipes other user settings.
- Fixed default model not sticking — pinning a model was incorrectly overwriting the default model setting with the pinned models list.

## v2.3.1 — March 30, 2026

### What's New
- Added German and French conversational voice options for Marvis Neural TTS.
- Added minimize/PiP for voice calls — tap the chevron button in the voice call screen to shrink it to a floating pill. Tap the pill to restore the full call, or tap the red button to end it. The call stays active while minimized.

### Improvements
- Drastically improved TTS text-to-speech naturalness: Sentences now create proper pauses, even better than openwebui splitting.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed voice calls not starting to speak until the full AI response finished generating — responses now begin playing as soon as the first complete sentence arrives.
- Fixed audible gaps between spoken sentences in server-side TTS — replaced the old polling-based audio player with gapless queue playback so chunks play back-to-back without any pauses.

## v2.3 — March 30, 2026

### What's New
- Added Action Buttons support

### Improvements

- Model editor now supports enabling/disabling action buttons
- Toggle-filter functions now appear as toggleable tools in the Tools menu alongside regular tools.
- Filter functions are now properly resolved using the global vs per-model logic — global filters always apply, per-model filters respect configuration.
- Starter prompt cards on the welcome screen now fall back to per-model suggestion prompts when the admin hasn't set global prompts, and update automatically when switching models.
- The TTS/STT settings screen now correctly shows "Not Loaded" (when the model is downloaded but not in memory) vs "Not Downloaded" (when no model files exist on disk), and the download/load button label and icon also adapt accordingly.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed on-device TTS and STT models taking up twice the expected storage — the HuggingFace download library was leaving a duplicate blob cache alongside the working model files. Existing users will automatically reclaim the wasted space on their next app launch.
- Fixed Shift+Enter intermittently sending the message instead of inserting a new line on iPad with a hardware keyboard.
- Fixed accessibility sizing not applying to assistant messages, drawer lists, and input boxes. 
- Fixed orphaned `</think>` closing tags leaking into chat messages as visible code blocks when models like Qwen skip the opening tag or when streaming splits tags across chunks.
- Fixed selecting a model and immediately sending a message no longer uses stale config.

## v2.2 — March 28, 2026

### What's New
- Added pinned models — star any model in the model picker to pin it for quick access. Pinned models appear in a dedicated section at the top of the picker and as shortcuts in the sidebar, synced with your Open WebUI server.
- Model picker now shows the currently selected model at the top of the sheet for easy reference.

### Improvements
- Home screen widgets with full theme support — widgets now properly adapt to Default, Dark, Clear, and Tinted modes instead of being stuck on a dark background.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed thinking/reasoning blocks from models (Qwen, DeepSeek, etc.) showing as raw tags in the chat instead of rendering as a collapsible "Thinking" section. Now handles all six reasoning tag formats during streaming and fixes stray summary tags leaking mid-stream.
- Fixed on-device audio transcription cutting off the last portion (and many words throughout) of uploaded audio.

## v2.1 — March 27, 2026

### What's New

- Fixed multiple bugs related to STT and TTS pipeline.
- Fixed profile picture not loading in settings. 

## v1.3.1 — March 22, 2026

### What's New
- Completely redesigned model picker — tap the model name in the toolbar to open a native bottom sheet with search and filter pills (by connection type and tag).
- Folders can now have a default model set when creating them
- Folders, Channels, and Notes in the drawer are now hidden when the server has those features disabled.
- Added delete confirmation dialogs for chats, folders, and channels across all views
- Channels list now groups conversations by type: Direct Messages, Groups, and Channels — making it easier to find what you need at a glance.
- iPad conversation context menu now includes Share, Clone, Remove from Folder, and a grouped Download submenu — fully matching iPhone.
- iPad now supports editing folder settings (name, system prompt, knowledge) after creation.
- iPad subfolders now render correctly in a nested tree layout, matching iPhone.
- iPad voice transcription is no longer accidentally cancelled when tapping New Chat while recording is in progress.

### Improvements
- Performance boost for streaming and code blocks rendering.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed "Delete Folder Only" incorrectly deleting the chats inside — chats are now properly moved to your main chat list instead.
- Fixed the tool state resetting when enabling new tools.
- Fixed deleting models in settings -> STT/TTS.

## v1.3 — March 20, 2026

### What's New
- Added multi-server management — save multiple OpenWebUI server connections and switch between them instantly from Settings or the server connection screen. 
- Chat sharing is now fully functional. Long-press any conversation and tap Share to open the share menu.
- Complete support for memories - Added Enable Memory toggle in Settings → Personalization → Memories to enable/disable the feature
- Folders now support full project workspace configuration — long-press any folder to edit its name, system prompt, default models, and attached knowledge bases (RAG context for all chats in the folder).
- Added custom headers on sign in. 

### Improvements
- On iPad with a Magic Keyboard or other hardware keyboard, pressing Enter now sends the message and Shift+Enter inserts a new line — matching the natural expectation when typing on a physical keyboard.
- Added a dedicated Feedback section in Settings → About
- Compacted the channel toolbar action icons (pin, members, settings) for better visual balance.
- Added a "New Chat" button to the drawer bottom bar so you can start a new chat from anywhere, including while inside a channel.
- All drawer rows (channels, chats, folders) are now tappable across the full row width, not just over the text.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed email/password login failing with "Failed to decode response" when connecting via an HTTP URL that redirects to HTTPS — the app now automatically detects and upgrades to the HTTPS address.
- Fixed OAuth sign-in getting stuck on "Authenticating…" indefinitely after a successful OAuth flow — login now completes correctly.
- Fixed member avatars not showing properly throughout channels ui. 
- Fixed selected members not appearing in the "Initial Members" list when adding them during Group channel creation.
- Fixed welcome screen prompt cards not appearing on the very first app launch
- Fixed chats not loading older than a month. Now chats will properly load and match the openwebui grouping.
- Fixed model and user avatar images showing an infinite loading shimmer on servers using self-signed certificates.


## v1.2.1 — March 18, 2026

### What's New
- Servers protected by auth proxies (Authelia, Authentik, Keycloak, oauth2-proxy, etc.) now show a sign-in WebView instead of a "proxy authentication" error, letting you authenticate through whatever portal your server uses.

### Improvements
- Welcome screen prompt suggestions are now sourced from the server's.
- Allow STT language change within the call feature.
- Tapping an audio attachment chip after on-device transcription now opens a preview sheet showing the full transcript text, with a copy button, before sending.
- Audio files attached in chat are now uploaded to the server by default (server handles transcription automatically). On-Device transcription is available as an alternative in Settings → Speech-to-Text → Audio File Transcription.

### Bug Fixes
- File attachments now show a distinct "Processing…" spinner for server-side transcription as well after upload completes, so you can see when the server is indexing or transcribing the file before it's ready to send.
- Fixed audio file transcription being cancelled when navigating away from a chat — transcription now continues in the background and completes even if you switch chats.
- Fixed channels incorrectly showing as read-only for the channel owner and members with write access when access grants were present.
- Fixed background chat content (e.g. prompt cards) being accidentally tappable or scrollable while swiping to open the left or right drawer panel.
- Fixed function calling mode not being respected — the app was incorrectly overriding the server's per-model setting; it now lets the server control this entirely, matching the web client behavior.

## v1.2 — March 16, 2026

### What's New
- Added Channels — collaborative, topic-based chat rooms where multiple users and AI models interact.
- Added Accessibility settings with customizable text scaling — independently adjust message text, conversation titles, and UI elements (buttons, icons, spacing) with live preview and quick presets.
- Added slash command prompt library — type `/` in the chat input to browse and search your Open WebUI prompt library.

### Improvements
- Inline source citations now appear as small, elevated pill badges showing shortened page titles or domain names — matching the Open WebUI web interface style.
- Profile/model avatars will now show properly.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed repeated `heartbeat() missing 1 required positional argument: 'data'` errors in Open WebUI server logs
- Fixed web search, image generation, and code interpreter toggles being ignored when turned off mid-chat — toggling a tool off now correctly prevents it from being used.
- Fixed conversations older than "This Month" not loading — pagination now properly triggers when scrolling to the bottom, allowing all conversation history to load.

## v1.1.0 — March 12, 2026

### What's New
- Added Cloudflare protected endpoint support.

### Improvements
- Full iPad layout overhaul — persistent sidebar, centered reading width, 4-column prompt grid, terminal as persistent panel.
- Added example URL placeholder in the server connection field so users know to include http:// or https:// in their URL.
- Moved the terminal toggle from the pills row to a compact inline icon next to the voice button, keeping the chat input single-line when no quick pills are pinned.
- Redesigned onboarding experience.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed dollar amounts being incorrectly rendered as math equations instead of plain text.
- Fixed stale model list persisting after signing out and logging into a different server or account — models now refresh correctly without needing to restart the app.
- Fixed model avatars not updating when changed by the admin — avatar images are now properly invalidated and re-fetched on each model refresh.
- Fixed false proxy error on Cloudflare-protected servers.

## v1.0.0 — March 12, 2026

### What's New
- Added `@` model mention — type `@` in the chat input to quickly switch which model handles your message. Pick a model from the fluent popup, and a persistent chip appears in the composer showing the active override. The override stays until you dismiss it or pick a different model, letting you freely switch between models mid-conversation without changing the chat's default.
- Added Open Terminal integration — enable terminal access for AI models directly from the chat input pill, giving the model the ability to run commands, manage files, and interact with a real Linux environment.
- Added Terminal File Browser — swipe from the right edge to open a slide-over file panel with directory navigation, breadcrumb path bar, file upload, folder creation, file preview/download, and a built-in mini terminal for running commands directly.
- Added native SVG rendering in chat messages — AI-generated SVG code blocks now display as crisp, zoomable images with a header bar, Image/Source toggle, copy button, and fullscreen view with pinch-to-zoom and share sheet support.
- Added native Mermaid diagram rendering in chat messages (flowcharts, state, sequence, class, and ER diagrams rendered as beautiful images).
- Added Memories management (Settings → Personalization → Memories) — view, add, edit, and delete AI memories that persist across conversations.
- Added "Archive All Chats" option in the chat list menu for bulk archiving.

### Improvements
- App now sends timezone to the server on login, matching the web client for correct server-side date formatting.
- Archived chats endpoint now supports search, sort, and filter parameters for faster navigation.
- Matching formatting of content to the Open WebUI formatting.
- Sidebar drawer now slides smoothly with your finger.
- Returning to an existing chat now remembers the last model used in that conversation instead of reverting to the default model.
- Unified TTS and STT under a single mlx-audio-swift package, replacing two separate dependencies for smaller app size and easier maintenance.
- Improved audio transcription for long files with energy-based silence detection for smarter chunking at natural pauses.
- Smoother TTS audio playback with automatic crossfading between chunks, eliminating audio artifacts at sentence boundaries.
- User-attached images and files now display inline inside the message bubble instead of floating above it.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed chat search using wrong query parameter, which could cause search to silently fail on some server versions.
- Fixed tag removal using incorrect API endpoint format (path-based instead of body-based DELETE).
- Fixed tag addition using wrong request body field name.
- Fixed tags list fetching from wrong endpoint, now uses the correct structured tags API.
- Fixed clone conversation not sending required request body.
- Fixed feature toggles (Web Search, Image Generation, Code Interpreter) still appearing in the tools menu even when the admin disabled the capability on the model. Toggles now respect per-model capabilities.
- Fixed tool-generated file download links opening in Safari instead of downloading within the app. Files are now downloaded and presented via the share sheet.
- Fixed some chats created from the app appearing blank or corrupted on the Open WebUI web interface.
- Fixed uploaded photos, PDFs, and other files not displaying on the Open WebUI web interface when sent from the app.
- Fixed chat view becoming pannable in all directions after follow-up suggestions appear, instead of strictly vertical scrolling.
- Fixed image uploads exceeding the 5 MB API limit by automatically downsampling photos to 2 megapixels before upload.
- Fixed external response stream not stopping when clicking the stop button.
